# AIReady Strategic Plan — Q1 2026

> Strategic pivots and implementation priorities based on market analysis and solo founder constraints.

---

## 🎯 Key Strategic Pivots

### 1. From "Scanner" to "Gatekeeper"

**Problem:** Static analysis tools suffer from "clean-up once and leave" problem. Users run the tool, fix issues, then cancel subscriptions.

**Solution:** Position as a CI/CD gatekeeper that blocks PRs from merging if they break the AI context budget.

**Implementation:**

- ✅ Added `--ci` flag with GitHub Actions annotations
- ✅ Added `--fail-on` for granular control (critical, major, any)
- ✅ Added `--threshold` for score-based blocking
- 🔜 Create GitHub Action marketplace action
- 🔜 Add GitLab CI template

**Value Prop:** "Don't let this PR merge because it breaks our context budget"

---

### 2. MVP Launch: Free Tier Only (Updated Strategy)

**Problem:** Billing complexity creates friction for initial users. Solo founder needs to validate product-market fit before investing in payment infrastructure.

**Solution:** Launch with Free tier only. Mark Pro, Team, and Enterprise as "Coming Soon". Gather users and feedback before monetizing.

**Implementation:**

- ✅ Added `MVP_FREE_ONLY = true` flag in plans.ts
- ✅ Updated pricing.md with "Available Now" / "Coming Soon" labels
- ✅ Updated middleware to show friendly "coming soon" messages
- ✅ All users default to free plan (3 repos, 10 runs/month)
- 🔜 Set `MVP_FREE_ONLY = false` when ready for paid tiers

**Value Prop:** "Get started immediately — no credit card required"

**When to Enable Paid Tiers:**

1. 500+ active free users
2. Clear demand signal (users hitting limits)
3. Stripe products/prices configured
4. Payment flow tested

---

### 3. Realistic Revenue Timeline

**Problem:** Original projections were overly optimistic ($177K ARR in Year 1).

**Solution:** Grounded projections based on solo founder constraints.

| Phase              | Timeline     | Target     | Focus                      |
| ------------------ | ------------ | ---------- | -------------------------- |
| **The Grind**      | Months 1–4   | $245 MRR   | Bug fixes, SEO, PMF        |
| **The Validation** | Months 5–9   | $2,000 MRR | First Team pilots, CI/CD   |
| **The Breakout**   | Months 10–18 | $5,500 MRR | Organic growth, automation |

**Path to Senior Dev Salary ($15k/mo):** 18–24 months (not 12)

### 4. Architecture for the Trough of Sorrow

**Problem:** Need to survive the Month 7 growth plateau with minimal costs.

**Solution:** Serverless architecture with $0 cost at 0 users.

**Decisions:**

- ❌ **No DAX** — Adds $40/mo minimum, DynamoDB latency is sufficient
- ✅ **Lambda reserved concurrency = 50** — Prevent cascade failures
- ✅ **SQS for repo processing** — Built-in backpressure for Enterprise scale

**Cost Projection:**

| Users  | Monthly Cost |
| ------ | ------------ |
| 0      | ~$1          |
| 100    | ~$22         |
| 1,000  | ~$105        |
| 10,000 | ~$600        |

---

### 5. CLI as Lead Magnet

**Problem:** Need compelling free tier that drives SaaS upgrades.

**Solution:** Make CLI output so valuable that SaaS historical trends feel like a "must-have" next step.

**Implementation:**

- ✅ Enhanced CI mode with GitHub Actions annotations
- ✅ Clear pass/fail messaging with upsell to Team plan
- 🔜 Improve console output formatting
- 🔜 Add SaaS upsell messaging in CLI output

---

## 📊 Competitive Positioning

### The "Gold Rush" Risk

Large players (SonarQube, Snyk, GitHub Advanced Security) will likely add "AI Context Scoring" features.

**Our Advantage:**

1. **Agility** — Solo founder can ship in days, not quarters
2. **Niche focus** — LLM token optimization, not general code quality
3. **Serverless cost structure** — Survive where competitors burn cash

### Moats to Build

1. **Content Moat** — Turn blog series into "State of AI-Readiness" annual report
2. **Data Moat** — Aggregate anonymized metrics for benchmarking
3. **Integration Moat** — Deep GitHub Actions integration before competitors
