## Realistic Revenue Projections

Based on market analysis and solo founder constraints, here's a grounded timeline:

| Phase              | Timeline     | Realistic Goal                             | Focus Area                                 |
| ------------------ | ------------ | ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| **The Grind**      | Months 1–4   | 500 Free / 5 Pro ($245 MRR)                | Bug fixes, SEO, Product-Market Fit         |
| **The Validation** | Months 5–9   | 2,000 Free / 30 Pro / 2 Team ($1.6k MRR)   | First Team pilots, CI/CD integration       |
| **The Breakout**   | Months 10–18 | 5,000 Free / 100 Pro / 10 Team ($5.9k MRR) | Scaling organic growth, automating support |

### Key Insight: "Trough of Sorrow"

- **Requires:** ~150 Pro + ~50 Team + 2 Enterprise customers
