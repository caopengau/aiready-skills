# Consolidated Implementation Plan

This plan consolidates outstanding actions from the repository's implementation notes and archives completed implementation documents.

Summary:

- Archived completed implementation docs to `.github/archived-docs/`.
- Consolidated remaining work (actionable items) from `V1-READINESS-ASSESSMENT.md` and `ENTERPRISE-READINESS-PLAN.md` into the tasks below.

Unfinished Documents (consolidated tasks)

1. V1-READINESS-ASSESSMENT.md — Status: Needs follow-up
   - Action A: Pattern-detect improvements
     - Add `--exclude-patterns` config for design system components.
     - Make similarity threshold configurable (default >=50%).
     - Add confidence scores and a false-positive whitelist.
     - Owner: `@pattern-detect` maintainer
     - ETA: 2 weeks (quick wins)

   - Action B: Context-analyzer tuning
     - Adjust cohesion algorithm for content-heavy files.
     - Add file-type detection (content vs logic) and configurable thresholds.
     - Reduce fragmentation severity for intentional separations.
     - Owner: `@context-analyzer` maintainer
     - ETA: 2-3 weeks

   - Action C: Consistency checker improvements
     - Whitelist common abbreviations to reduce naming noise.
     - Improve parser robustness and error handling.
     - Recalibrate severity for naming vs structural consistency.
     - Owner: `@consistency` maintainer
     - ETA: 2-4 weeks

2. ENTERPRISE-READINESS-PLAN.md — Status: Roadmap; needs execution
   - Phase 1 (Quick Wins) — Completed in docs, move remaining items to issues:
     - Messaging audit (landing copy) — done.
     - Security docs — done.
     - Create GH issues for remaining Phase 1 items that are not yet implemented.

   - Phase 2 (Core Features) — Prioritize and create issues:
     - `--read-only` default mode and `--save` opt-in
     - `--group-by team` (CODEOWNERS parsing)
     - `--ai-impact` estimation mode
     - Owner: triage to core or respective package teams
     - ETA: plan per-issue

   - Phase 3+ — Enterprise features (dashboards, sharing, history) — add RFCs where needed.

Archive and cleanup actions performed

- Moved completed documents into `.github/archived-docs/` (copies preserved).
- Originals removed from repo root to reduce top-level clutter.

Files archived

- `.github/archived-docs/PHASE-1-IMPLEMENTATION-SUMMARY.md`
- `.github/archived-docs/NOT-ANOTHER-LINTER.md`
- `.github/archived-docs/LANDING-RELEASE-IMPLEMENTATION.md`
- `.github/archived-docs/AEO-UCP-IMPLEMENTATION.md`

Next steps

- Review this consolidated plan and confirm owners for tasks.
- I can open GH issues for the prioritized tasks (confirm assignees and labels).
- If you prefer copies left at repo root instead of archived, tell me and I'll revert the deletions.
