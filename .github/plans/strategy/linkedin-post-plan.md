# AIReady LinkedIn Posting Plan

**Status:** Planning → Execution  
**Target Platform:** LinkedIn (personal profile)  
**Cadence:** Every other day (3-4 posts/week)  
**Primary Goal:** Build awareness + community around objective AI-readiness metrics  
**Secondary Goal:** Drive traffic to blog + `getaiready.dev` guided onboarding

---

## Strategic Positioning

**Core Narrative:**
AI-native development should be measured, not guessed.

**Message Pillars:**

1. **Objective Metrics > Vibes**  
   AI output quality improves when codebase structure improves.
2. **Simplicity Wins**  
   Small, focused modules reduce AI confusion and human review cost.
3. **Human-in-the-Loop is Mission Critical**  
   AI accelerates delivery, but human architecture + review guardrails ensure safety.
4. **Builder-Friendly**  
   Not everyone is deeply technical; innovators/executioners can still adopt practical checks quickly.

## Post Drafts — Copy-Paste Ready

Below are the 14 LinkedIn posts drafted from the 4-week calendar. Each post is ready to copy and paste — UTM-tagged links included.

**Day 1 — Mission Post**
AI-native development should be measured, not guessed.

If your team is using AI tools daily but quality feels random, the issue is often not the model — it’s unclear signals in the codebase.

I’m building AIReady to help teams objectively measure what improves AI output quality:

- semantic duplication
- context fragmentation
- consistency drift

Humans still make the final call. But better metrics make those calls faster and safer.

Try the guided start: <https://getaiready.dev?utm_source=linkedin&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=thought-leadership&utm_content=day01-main-post>

What’s one quality signal your team wishes you could measure better?  
# AI #DeveloperTools #CodeQuality

---

**Day 3 — Metric Spotlight (Semantic Duplicates)**
Your AI assistant can rewrite the same logic 5 different ways.

Why? Semantic duplicates.

When business logic is duplicated with different names/structures, AI sees multiple “valid” patterns and picks inconsistently.

Simplicity helps. One clear pattern beats five clever variants.

Measure your repo here: <https://getaiready.dev?utm_source=linkedin&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=thought-leadership&utm_content=day03-main-post>

Human-in-the-loop is mission critical: AI drafts fast, humans choose the standard.

Have you seen this in validation/auth code?  
# AIEngineering #Refactoring #CodeQuality

**Day 5 — Case Snippet (Import Chains)**
Before: 8 files, hidden overhead, noisy AI suggestions.  
After: simpler modules, faster reviews, fewer surprises.

Small refactors in import chains can dramatically reduce context load for AI and humans.

The lesson: simplify module boundaries first. Fancy prompts come second.

Try the guided flow: <https://getaiready.dev?utm_source=linkedin&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=thought-leadership&utm_content=day05-main-post>

**Day 7 — Human-in-the-Loop Post**
AI can draft fast. Humans must own architecture and final decisions.

My rule:

- AI for speed
- Humans for boundaries, risk, and trade-offs

When teams skip human review discipline, velocity rises briefly and debt compounds quietly.

AIReady’s mission is simple: make quality visible so human reviews are focused, not reactive.

**Day 9 — Blog Promo (Part 5)**
Every import you add has a hidden cost in AI-assisted development.

Deep import chains increase context load, create noise, and slow down both AI suggestions and human review.

I broke this down in Part 5:
The Hidden Cost of Import Chains  
<https://getaiready.dev/blog/hidden-cost-import-chains?utm_source=linkedin&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=thought-leadership&utm_content=day09-blog-post>

If you want practical ways to simplify without over-refactoring, this one is for you.

Tools + guided start: <https://getaiready.dev?utm_source=linkedin&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=thought-leadership&utm_content=day09-tools>

Which module has the deepest import chain in your repo today?

**Day 11 — Mythbuster**
Myth: “AI code is bad.”  
Reality: unclear codebase signals produce inconsistent AI output.

If patterns are fragmented, naming is mixed, and modules are noisy, AI mirrors that ambiguity.

The fix isn’t banning AI.  
The fix is making your architecture easier to read — for both models and humans.

Measure first: <https://getaiready.dev?utm_source=linkedin&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=thought-leadership&utm_content=day11-main-post>

What’s more effective in your team right now: prompt tuning or codebase simplification?  
# AI #Architecture #CodeQuality

**Day 13 — Builder-Friendly Post**
You don’t need to be a software architect to improve AI output quality.

Start with 3 simple checks:

1) Is the same logic repeated in multiple places?
2) Is one feature spread across too many files?
3) Can a new teammate explain this module in 60 seconds?

If “no” on any of these, that’s your first refactor candidate.

Try the guided onboarding: <https://getaiready.dev?utm_source=linkedin&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=thought-leadership&utm_content=day13-main-post>

Human-in-loop remains non-negotiable: AI helps execute, humans decide standards.

Which of these 3 checks fails most in your project?  
# BuildInPublic #AI #DeveloperTools

---

**Day 15 — Metric Spotlight (Context Budget)**
“Context budget” in plain English: how much code AI must load before it can help correctly.

Higher budget usually means:

- slower suggestions
- more irrelevant output
- more review burden

Simpler module boundaries reduce context budget and improve both speed and quality.

Learn + run checks: <https://getaiready.dev?utm_source=linkedin&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=thought-leadership&utm_content=day15-main-post>

Where do you feel context overload most: APIs, auth, or data layer?

**Day 17 — Agentic Workflow Post**
We updated AIReady with an agentic way to get started.

Instead of guessing where to begin, you get guided steps to run the right checks and act on real signals.

Goal: less setup friction, more practical improvement.

Try it: <https://getaiready.dev?utm_source=linkedin&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=thought-leadership&utm_content=day17-main-post>

Even with agentic workflows, keep humans in the loop for architecture and risk decisions.

What’s your ideal onboarding: checklist, wizard, or AI guide?

**Day 19 — ReceiptClaimer Lesson**
Building ReceiptClaimer taught me this:

AI speed is easy to unlock.  
AI consistency is hard to sustain.

As features grow, fragmented modules and mixed patterns quietly degrade output quality.

That’s one reason I started AIReady: objective metrics for AI-native development efficiency.

Explore the approach: <https://getaiready.dev?utm_source=linkedin&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=thought-leadership&utm_content=day19-main-post>

What changed your team’s AI quality most: better prompts or better structure?  
# FounderJourney #AI #CodeQuality

---

**Day 21 — Community Ask**
I want to analyze more real-world repos (public or anonymized examples) to improve AIReady guidance.

If you have a codebase with:

- messy module boundaries
- duplicate logic
- unpredictable AI suggestions

I’d love to learn from it and share practical patterns back with the community.

Start here: <https://getaiready.dev?utm_source=linkedin&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=thought-leadership&utm_content=day21-main-post>

Comment “analyze” and I’ll DM details.

**Day 23 — Blog Teaser**
Next post is about making invisible architecture issues visible faster.

Text logs tell you what is wrong.  
Visual structure tells you where to fix first.

Teaser + previous posts: <https://getaiready.dev/blog?utm_source=linkedin&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=thought-leadership&utm_content=day23-blog-teaser>

In AI-native workflows, faster diagnosis means safer velocity — with humans steering the decisions.

**Day 25 — Practical Refactor Tip**
Quick win for this week:

Pick one messy domain and do only this:

- define one entry module
- reduce cross-imports
- remove one duplicate path

No rewrite. No big migration. Just one clean boundary.

Small structural wins create better AI suggestions and cleaner human reviews.

Try this with guided steps: <https://getaiready.dev?utm_source=linkedin&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=thought-leadership&utm_content=day25-main-post>

**Day 27 — Poll Post**
Poll: What’s your biggest bottleneck in AI-assisted development right now?

A) Inconsistent code patterns  
B) High review effort  
C) Context/token overhead  
D) Security/compliance risk

I’m tracking this because AI-native development needs objective metrics, not guesses.

If you want a practical baseline before improving, start here: <https://getaiready.dev?utm_source=linkedin&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=thought-leadership&utm_content=day27-poll-post>

Human-in-the-loop remains mission critical — especially for architecture and risk decisions.
