# AIReady - AI-Ready Codebase Optimization Tools

**Purpose**: Free, open-source CLI tools to optimize codebases for AI collaboration

**Quick Start**: `npx @aiready/cli scan .`

## What is AIReady?

AIReady is a free command-line tool that analyzes your codebase to identify issues that make it harder for AI models (like ChatGPT, Claude, or GitHub Copilot) to understand and work with your code effectively.

## Key Features

### 1. Semantic Duplicate Detection
- Identifies functionally similar code patterns across your codebase
- Finds variations that waste AI context window tokens
- Language: TypeScript/JavaScript (Python & Java coming soon)

### 2. Context Window Analysis  
- Calculates token usage for AI models (GPT-4, Claude, etc.)
- Identifies context fragmentation issues
- Optimizes file organization for better AI understanding

### 3. Code Consistency Checking
- Detects pattern inconsistencies that confuse AI models
- Ensures naming conventions and code structure are learnable
- Checks for anti-patterns in AI-assisted development

### 4. AI Readiness Score
- Quantifies how well your code works with AI tools
- Provides actionable recommendations
- Tracks improvement over time

## How to Use

```bash
# Option 1: Run directly with npx (no installation)
npx @aiready/cli scan .

# Option 2: Install globally
npm install -g @aiready/cli
aiready scan .

# Option 3: Add to package.json
npm install --save-dev @aiready/cli
npx aiready scan .
```

## Privacy & Security

- ✅ Runs completely offline on your local machine
- ✅ Zero network calls - no code is uploaded anywhere
- ✅ No SaaS, no cloud processing
- ✅ Air-gap compatible for secure environments
- ✅ Open source - inspect the code yourself

## Comparison: AIReady vs Linters

**ESLint/TSLint**: Check syntax correctness, coding standards, potential bugs
**AIReady**: Checks AI understandability, semantic duplicates, context optimization

They complement each other - use both for best results.

## Pricing

100% Free. Open source under MIT license.

## Support

- GitHub: https://github.com/caopengau/aiready-cli
- Issues: https://github.com/caopengau/aiready-cli/issues
- npm: https://www.npmjs.com/package/@aiready/cli
- Documentation: https://github.com/caopengau/aiready-cli#readme

## Use Cases

1. **Before AI Pair Programming**: Optimize your codebase before starting AI-assisted development
2. **Code Reviews**: Check if new code maintains AI-friendly patterns
3. **Legacy Code Modernization**: Identify areas that need refactoring for AI collaboration
4. **Onboarding**: Help new team members understand codebase patterns
5. **Monorepo Management**: Maintain consistency across multiple packages

## Requirements

- Node.js 18 or higher
- npm or pnpm package manager

## Common Questions

**Q: Is my code uploaded anywhere?**
A: No. Everything runs locally on your machine. Zero network calls.

**Q: What languages are supported?**
A: Currently TypeScript and JavaScript. Python and Java support coming in 2025.

**Q: How is this different from a linter?**
A: Linters check code correctness. AIReady checks AI understandability - semantic duplicates, context fragmentation, pattern consistency.

**Q: Can I use it in CI/CD?**
A: Yes! AIReady can be integrated into your CI/CD pipeline to maintain AI readiness scores.

**Q: Is it free for commercial use?**
A: Yes. MIT license allows commercial use.

## Installation Alternatives

```bash
# npm
npm install -g @aiready/cli

# pnpm  
pnpm add -g @aiready/cli

# yarn
yarn global add @aiready/cli
```

## Output Format

AIReady generates detailed JSON and Markdown reports including:
- AI Readiness Score (0-100)
- List of semantic duplicates with similarity scores
- Context window analysis with token counts
- Pattern consistency violations
- Actionable recommendations
