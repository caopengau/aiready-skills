For decades, software teams have relied on metrics like cyclomatic complexity, code coverage, and lint warnings to measure code quality. These tools were designed for human reviewers. But as AI-assisted development becomes the norm, these old metrics are no longer enough. AI models don’t “see” code the way humans do. They don’t care about your coverage percentage or how many branches your function has. What matters is how much context they can fit, how consistent your patterns are, and how much semantic duplication lurks beneath the surface.

That’s why we built **AIReady**: to measure what actually matters for AI-driven teams.

## Why Existing Tools Fall Short

Tools like **madge** and **dependency-cruiser** are great for visualizing dependencies and spotting cycles, but they don’t answer the questions that matter for AI:
- How much of your codebase is semantically duplicated?
- How fragmented is your domain logic across files?
- How consistent are your naming and patterns?

Traditional metrics miss these AI-specific pain points.

## The Three Dimensions of AI-Readiness

AIReady focuses on three core metrics:

### 1. Semantic Similarity (`pattern-detect`)
- **What it is:** Finds code that does the same thing, even if it looks different.
- **How:** Uses Jaccard similarity on AST tokens to detect “semantic duplicates.”
- **Why it matters:** AI models waste context window on repeated logic, making suggestions less relevant and increasing maintenance cost.

```typescript
// File 1
function validateUser(u) { return u.id && u.email.includes('@'); }
// File 2
const isValidUser = (user) => user.id && user.email.indexOf('@') !== -1;
```

### 2. Context Budget (`context-analyzer`)
- **What it is:** Measures the “token cost” of understanding a feature or file.
- **How:** Analyzes import chains, file size, and fragmentation to estimate how much context an AI needs to answer a question about your code.
- **Why it matters:** The more fragmented your logic, the more tokens are needed—quickly exceeding the model’s window and leading to hallucinations or missed context.

```typescript
// src/api/users.ts
import { getUserById } from '../services/user-service'; // +2,100 tokens
import { validateUser } from '../utils/user-validation'; // +1,800 tokens
// ...
```

### 3. Consistency Scoring (`consistency`)
- **What it is:** Quantifies naming and pattern drift across your codebase.
- **How:** Tracks how often similar things are named or structured differently.
- **Why it matters:** Inconsistent code confuses both humans and AIs, reducing the quality of suggestions and increasing onboarding time.

- `getUserById`, `fetchUser`, `retrieveUser` — all for the same operation.

## Hub-and-Spoke Architecture: Flexibility by Design

AIReady uses a **hub-and-spoke** model:
- **Hub:** Shared utilities, types, and the CLI interface.
- **Spokes:** Each metric is a focused tool (pattern-detect, context-analyzer, consistency), independently useful and pluggable.

This makes it easy to add new metrics, customize for your team, and keep the core lean.

## Smart Defaults: Focus on What Matters

By default, AIReady surfaces the ~10 most serious issues in each category. No more drowning in thousands of low-priority warnings—just the problems that will actually move the needle for your team.

## Open Source and Configurable

AIReady is open source and designed for customization:
- Tweak thresholds, add or remove metrics, and integrate with your CI/CD.
- Teams can adapt the tools to their own context and priorities.

## Conclusion

If you’re still measuring code quality with tools built for humans, you’re missing the real blockers to AI productivity. AIReady gives you the metrics that actually matter—so you can build codebases that are ready for the future.

**Try it yourself:**
```bash
npx @aiready/pattern-detect ./src
npx @aiready/context-analyzer ./src
```
