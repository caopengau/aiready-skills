## Getting Started

A minimal start: run a scan, then visualize the results.

```bash
# 1) Run analysis (defaults to JSON output)
aiready scan .

# 2) Visualize the generated report
aiready visualise
```

Notes:

- `aiready scan` now defaults to JSON output so you can pipe or save reports easily.
- The visualizer lives in `packages/visualizer` and provides a friendly interactive view of the report.
- If you prefer npm/pnpm scripts, the repo includes convenience scripts that wrap these commands.

## Visualizer

The Visualizer turns an AIReady JSON report into an interactive graph view. Quick options:

- Generate a static HTML from a report:

```bash
aiready visualise
```

- Start the interactive dev server (devs):

```bash
cd packages/visualizer
pnpm dev
```

The right-hand details panel shows paths relative to the project root for easier reading (hover to see the absolute path).

## Environment Variables

Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and fill in the required values:

```env
# Contact form submission endpoint (provided by SST deployment)
NEXT_PUBLIC_REQUEST_URL=your-api-endpoint-url
```

## Deployment

This project is configured for deployment with SST (Serverless Stack) to AWS. The deployment configuration is in `sst.config.ts` (not included in this public repo).

For local development, you can run:

```bash
npx sst dev
```
